Authentication/Application choice - Google

We decided to use Google as our choice of authentication as it would be the easiest to implement through Firebase.
We chose to make a web application as we both made a mobile application for EC327 but never a web application. This way, we could learn something entirely new.

Api choice - https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/MA/current.json?state=MA

We really liked this site since it showed the stats for each individual state while still providing detailed information for both daily stats and overall. Most of the other ones that we found
seemed to either be sorted by country or didn't provide enough information.
The most important info that we focused on was getting the daily stats, then we focused on getting the overall stats.

Daily Symptom Test

We ask the user a series of 9 questions then we give them instructions based on a score determined by their responses.

Advised to stay practicing social distancing if no symptoms shown.
Advised to quarantine if showing symptoms.
Advised to seek medical assistance if showing multiple symptoms.
